                &lt;i&gt;European Quality of Life Survey&lt;/i&gt; (EQLS) was prepared as open data,
                originally for the UK Data Serviceâ€™s first App Challenge in summer 2015. It is a
                harmonised subset of variables taken from the larger &lt;a
                href="http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/Catalogue/?sn=7348" target="_new" &gt;
                EQLS Integrated Data File&lt;/a&gt; (SN 7348).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The
                &lt;i&gt;European Quality of Life Survey&lt;/i&gt; (EQLS) is one of a number of key
                surveys carried out by the &lt;i&gt;European Foundation for the Improvement of
                Living and Working Conditions&lt;/i&gt; (Eurofound), a European Union Agency that
                was established in 1975 to contribute to the planning and design of better living
                and working conditions. Eurofound carries out its role in partnership with
                governments, employers, trade unions and the European Union institutions.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; The EQLS is a unique, pan-European survey that examines both the
                objective circumstances of European citizens' lives and how they feel about those
                circumstances and their lives in general. It looks at a range of issues, such as
                employment, income, education, housing, family, health and work-life balance. It
                also looks at subjective topics, such as people's levels of happiness, how satisfied
                they are with their lives, and how they perceive the quality of their
                societies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Carried out every four years since 2003, the survey
                collects data on a range of issues, such as employment, income, education, housing,
                family, health and work-life balance. It also looks at subjective topics, such as
                people's levels of happiness, life satisfaction, and perceived quality of society.
                Over the years, the EQLS has developed into a valuable set of indicators which
                complements traditional indicators of economic growth and living standard such as
                GDP or income. These offer a unique source of comparative information on the quality
                of living and working conditions across the EU. The EQLS indicators are more
                inclusive of environmental and social aspects of progress and therefore are easily
                integrated into the decision-making process and taken up by public debate at EU and
                national levels in the European Union.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; By running the survey
                regularly, it has also become possible to track key trends in the quality of
                people's lives over time and gain deeper insight in the issues central to European
                policy. The results provide a strong basis for policy makers to identify
                opportunities for improvement and to develop forward looking perspectives. Previous
                surveys have shown, for instance, that people are having greater difficulty making
                ends meet since the economic crisis began. In many countries, they also feel that
                there is now more tension between people from different ethnic groups. And across
                Europe, people now trust their governments less than they did before. However,
                people still continue to get the greatest satisfaction from their family life and
                personal relationships.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Further information about the survey
                can be found on the &lt;i&gt;European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and
                Working Conditions&lt;/i&gt; (Eurofound) &lt;a

                &gt; EQLS&lt;/a&gt; web pages.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In each wave a sample of adult
                population is selected randomly for a face-to-face interview. In view of the
                prospective European enlargements the geographical coverage of the survey has
                expanded over time from 28 countries in 2003 to 34 countries in 2011-12.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First EQLS in 2003 - 28 countries: 27 EU Member States and
                Turkey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second EQLS in 2007-2008 - 31 countries: 27 EU Member
                States, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Turkey and Norway&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Third EQLS in
                2011-2012 - 34 countries: 27 EU Member States and Croatia, Iceland, FYR Macedonia,
                Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey and Kosovo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt; This open
                subset contains 195 variables from two years, 2007 and 2011-12, 3 weights, and the
                full number of cases, almost 80,000.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;Main
                Topics&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The survey covers multiple dimensions of quality of life:
                employment and work-life balance, income and deprivation, housing and local
                environment, family and social contacts, health and mental wellbeing, subjective
                wellbeing (e.g. happiness, life satisfaction), social exclusion, perceived quality
                of society (e.g. tensions, trust in institutions) as well as access to and perceived
                quality of public services. </abstract>

                    <![CDATA[ The European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) is a random probability survey of people aged 18 and over. The definition of the target of EQLS is the adult population (18+) living in private households. In order to be representative in terms of gender, age, urbanisation level, region and household size across all countries, three weighting coefficients were produced:<br> <ul><li>
    w4 - Final weight trimmed and standardised - this weight can be used for comparing any of the countries (both from EU and outside the EU) with each other and across different survey rounds (e.g. 2007 and 2011). However, this weight cannot be used to calculate an average for a group of countries.</li><li>
    w5_EU28 - Cross-national weight - EU28 - to calculate averages for all EU (as of 2013, that is including Croatia).</li><li>
    w5_total - Weight 5 total - a weight enabling any kind of grouping across different types of countries e.g. the Balkans, Nordic countries including Iceland or similar. However, because different countries were included in 2007 and 2011, it may not be possible to apply it for both years and the countries should be selected carefully.</li></ul>]]>

The UK Data Archive follows best practice guidance in the field of social science data sharing, taking its lead from the Office of National Statistics. Data owners and producers are responsible for signing off on confidentiality, following their own in-house protocols. For example, each government department may have its own classification system for data release of data and follow a bespoke standard. The Archive undertakes further routine checks on data to ensure the data meet our own confidentiality standards and match the type of licensing selected by the data depositor. Key survey variables are identified and checked for basic disclosure risk following the  <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/best-practice/disclosure-control-policy-for-social-survey-microdata/disclosure-control-guidance-for-microdata-produced-from-social-surveys.doc" target="_new" > UK Government Statistical Service (GSS) Disclosure Control Guidance for Microdata Produced from Social Surveys</a>. Release of other kinds of data, such as textual data, is approved by the owner/producer and is further checked by the Archive for disclosive information that may potentially be detrimental to meeting the original terms and conditions of the research and participant consent.
